# EDTASM6309 Documentation

This is a revival/update to the DISK EDTASM manual that includes Robert Gault's EDTASM6309 updates. 

https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Disks/Programming/EDTASM6309%20(Robert%20Gault).zip


## Description

This document relates to a major patch to Tandy's Disk EDTASM (editor/assembler) and offers many improvements over the original version and earlier patch versions. The program comes in two versions, one for the Coco 1 or 2 and the second for the Coco 3. The only user noticable difference is that the Coco3 version uses 40/80 column screens and runs in the fast 2MHz mode. Use RGBCNFIG.BAS to select whether the 40 or 80 column screen will be used.
